## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Failures
**Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors
```bash
npm run type-check
```
**Solution**: Check types directory and resolve TypeScript issues

#### Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: Cannot connect to Supabase
```bash
# Test connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
```
**Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL and network connectivity

#### Missing Environment Variables
**Issue**: Configuration not loaded
```bash
# Check environment variables
printenv | grep -E "(LEVERAGE|PROFIT|DEFI)"
```
**Solution**: Verify all required environment variables are set

#### Performance Issues
**Issue**: Slow dashboard loading
**Solution**: 
1. Check Redis caching is enabled
2. Verify database query optimization
3. Monitor network latency

### Emergency Procedures

#### Disable Leverage Engine
```bash
# Set environment variable
ENABLE_LEVERAGE_ENGINE=false

# Restart application
pm2 restart cival-dashboard
```

#### Disable Profit Securing
```bash
# Set environment variable
ENABLE_PROFIT_SECURING=false

# Restart application
systemctl restart cival-dashboard
```

# Run rollback migration
cd database
python3 run_leverage_migration.py --rollback
```
